# Inheritance and Interface:
Well i created today 6 classes for my project and four interfaces:
1. Restuarent Class: i created a restuarent class that has states and behaviors. I created a arrayList to hold the reviews in my class and in this i override two methods from two interfaces.
2. Review Class: In this class that has states and behaviors used a constructor, setter and getters and also used toString method.
3. Shops Class: In this class that has states and behaviors used a constructor, setter and getters and also used toString method. I created a arrayList to hold the reviews in my class and in this i override two methods from two interfaces.
4. Theater Class:  In this class that has states and behaviors used a constructor, setter and getters and also used toString method. I created a arrayList to hold the reviews in my class and in this i override two methods from two interfaces.

### Testing:
1. restaurantConstructor: is a test to make sure if the Restaurant constructor is behaving reasonably as it suppose to be.
2.  toStringTest: ensure that its toString is working properly.
3. addReviewTest: Add tests to ensure that when you call addReview, the association is created between the Restaurant and the Review.
4. testReviewConstructor:  is a test to make sure if the Review constructor is behaving reasonably as it suppose to be.
5. testToStringReview:  ensure that its toString is working properly.
6. testShopConstructor: is a test to make sure if the Shop constructor is behaving reasonably as it suppose to be.
7. testShopToString: ensure that its toString is working properly.
8. testTheaterConstructor: is a test to make sure if the Theater constructor is behaving reasonably as it suppose to be.
9. testToStringTheater: ensure that its toString is working properly.
10. testAddMovie: It make sure that the method adds movies to the arraylist.
11. testRemoveMovie: It make  sure that the method removes movies from the arraylist.
12. testReviewForTheater: It make  sure that the method adds/removes reviews from the arraylist of reviews.
